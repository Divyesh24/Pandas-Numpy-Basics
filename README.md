# Pandas-Numpy-Basics
Intro to Pandas and Numpy: Basic Exercises

Hello and welcome to Pandas-NumPy python introduction with some simple exercices. Let’s start with NumPy basics.  There are basic libraries which are really important for the data manipulation. So, first is ‘NumPy’ that is nothing but numeric python and then there is ‘pandas’ and then there is ‘scipy’. So, these three are the basic libraries which are very important for you to learn and these two things are very related the NumPy and pandas they are the core structure to handle the data. So, you need to understand NumPy and pandas when you are going to deal with the data.

## What is NumPy? 
NumPy is nothing but provides all the libraries to deal with the linear algebra. 
- NumPy, which stands for Numerical Python
- NumPy is the foundational package for mathematical computing 
- Mathematical and logical operations on arrays 
- Operations related to linear algebra. NumPy has inbuilt functions for linear algebra and random generation 
- ndarray is the core object in NumPy Basics ndarray 
- Multidimensional array 
- Homogeneous collection of values 
- Fast and efficient 
- Support for mathematical functions 
- Primary container for data exchange between python algorithms
